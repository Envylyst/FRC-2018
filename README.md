# FRC 2018

Team 4159 CardinalBotics' robot code for Rafiki, our 2018 season robot competing in FIRST Power Up

**Notes**

- This setup uses GradleRIO to build, deploy to robot, and manage dependencies
- Recommended: Intellij and unofficial FRC plugin for robot class templates
- `ssh admin@10.41.59.2` or `ssh admin@roboRIO-4159-frc.local`. Ask a veteran member for the password.
- Copy motion profiling csv files to the roboRIO's `/traj` folder. Easiest way is to use `scp`
